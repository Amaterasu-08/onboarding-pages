# onboarding Pages

Made an onboarding pages site for a fitness app using 
##React js + tailwind css + vite
The app exclusive mobile responsive for mobile screen of any parameter.

##How to use:
just click on the screen to go from one page to another. Didnt use react-router-dom as all the pages have the same use of delivering instruction to the app and basic registration
